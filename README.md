Mini jupyter-based "textbook" for learning python for data and scientific computing

## What is this?

This is a mini "textbook" derived from the course notes for
CIS 161:  Computational Science at Grand Valley State University.
It is primarily designed to teach Python (specifically Python 3.x)
in the context of using Python to solve problems in data, science,
and mathematics.


## How to use it?

Rather than a traditional textbook, it is meant to be interactive.
To allow this, each "chapter" is a jupyter notebook.  While it displays in
a formatted way automatically on Github, to actually run the code
you'll need to either:

* Run on Google's Colab by clicking the "Open on Colab" button that
  appears next to (and at the start) of each notebook.
    * This runs on remote servers -- no need to install anything.
    * You can run cells, modify code, and add new cells
    * To save your changes, you have 2 options:
        * save a copy to your Google Drive "File" -> "Save a copy in drive"
        * save a copy to your Github "File" -> "Save a copy in github"
          (though if you use github you 
    * Note: Colab uses a modified version of jupyter notebooks.
      All of the necessary functionality is there, but some
      of the options occur in slightly different locations.
* Download the .ipynb(s) and run the jupyter notebooks on your
  local machine.  To do this, you will need to install python3 and
  jupyter.  There are many ways to install python, but
  [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
  is often one of the easiest prepackaged python distributions to
  install that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
* Run the Jupyter notebooks with a different remote service
  such as [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) or [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/app).

This "textbook" is meant to be worked with in the order listed below,
but you should feel free to jump around or skip sections based on
your previous experience with Python.
